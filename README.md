GitHub Contributions
====================

A simple application that generates a repository that being added into your GitHub account creates a nice contributions calendar.

Installation
------------

    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/IonicaBizau/gh-contributions/master/installer.sh | sh

If your system does not have _wget_, you can also use _curl_:

    curl https://raw.github.com/IonicaBizau/gh-contributions/master/installer.sh -o install.sh; chmod +x install.sh;./install.sh; rm -rf install.sh

Example
-------

Design your GitHub contributions calendar using the designer from the browser:
